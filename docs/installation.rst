Installation
============

At this time the client library is not yet available on PyPI.

.. TODO:: Improve this?

To use the library, clone the GitHub repo into the desired
directory on your computer::

    git clone https://github.com/jamiehand/osf_api_v2_client.git your_directory_here

The source code that makes up the client is found in the ``osf_api_v2_client``
directory within the main library directory (that is, in
``osf_api_v2_client/osf_api_v2_client``).

.. TODO:: Once client library is available on PyPI,
    include the following instructions:

.. At the command line::

    $ easy_install osf_api_v2_client

.. Or, if you have virtualenvwrapper installed::

    $ mkvirtualenv osf_api_v2_client
    $ pip install osf_api_v2_client
